# Running localy
The "local" branch should contain all edits to run locally (adding a server/.env file, removing authentication and enabling --openssl-legacy-provider).

To start this branch localy:
1. Run npm install in both the server and client directory
2. Start a redis server on your machine
3. Run node on the server/index.js file
4. Run npm start in the client directory
